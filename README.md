# CS5105-Machine_Learning-Project_ViTalia
Got it! I'll make an engaging and well-structured `README.md` with emojis to make it visually appealing. Since I don't have direct access to your notebook's contents, I'll assume a CNN-based Malaria detection model using TensorFlow/Keras on the NIH dataset.  

Here's your enhanced `README.md`: 👇

### 📌 **Malaria Detection using Deep Learning**  

🚀 **An AI-powered Malaria detection system that classifies cell images as Infected or Uninfected using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).**  

---

## 📂 **Project Overview**  
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through mosquito bites. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning to automate malaria detection using microscopic images of blood smears.  

🔬 **Dataset:** NIH Malaria Cell Images  
🧠 **Model Used:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
📊 **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
🖥️ **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
